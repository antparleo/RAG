Endometriosis is thought by many to account for most of such losses and menstrual suppression or surgery prior to the next transfer has been reported to be beneficial. In this study, we performed endometrial biopsy in a subset of women with UEETF, testing for the oncogene BCL6 and the histone deacetylase SIRT1. We compared 205 PGT-A cycles outcomes and provide those results following treatment with GnRH agonist versus controls (no treatment). Based on these and previous promising results, we next performed a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the orally active GnRH antagonist, elagolix, to oral contraceptive pill (OCP) suppression for 2 months before the next euploid embryo transfer, and monitored inflammation and miRNA expression in blood, before and after treatment. These studies support a role for endometriosis in UEETF and suggest that medical suppression of suspected disease with GnRH antagonist prior to the next transfer could improve success rates and address underlying inflammatory and epigenetic changes associated with UEETF.',\n",
