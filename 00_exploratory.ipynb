       " 'Abstract': 'Objective: To determine the susceptibility of the endometrium to infection by- and thereby potential damage from- SARS-CoV-2. Design: Analysis of SARS-Cov-2 infection-related gene expression from endometrial transcriptomic data sets. Setting: Infertility research department affiliated with a public hospital. Patient(s): Gene expression data fromfive studies in 112 patients with normal endometrium collected throughout the menstrual cycle. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s):Gene expression and correlation between viral infectivity genes and age throughout the menstrual cycle. Result(s): Gene expression was high forTMPRSS4, CTSL, CTSB, FURIN, MX1, andBSG; medium forTMPRSS2; and low forACE2. ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, andMX1 expression increased toward the window of implantation.TMPRSS4 expression was positively correlated withACE2, CTSB, CTSL, MX1, andFURIN during several cycle phases;TMPRSS2 was not statistically significantly altered across the cycle.ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, BSG, andMX1 expression increased with age, especially in early phases of the cycle. Conclusion(s): Endometrial tissue is likely safe from SARS-CoV-2 cell entry based onACE2 and TMPRSS2expression, but susceptibility increases with age. Further,TMPRSS4, along withBSG-mediated viral entry into cells, could imply a susceptible environment for SARSCoV-2 entry via different mechanisms. Additional studies are warranted to determine the true risk of endometrial infection by SARS-CoV2 and implications for fertility treatments.

       " 'Introduction': 'T he rapid international spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in 5,103,006 con firmed cases and 333,401deaths worldwide as of May 23, 2020 . COVID-19 is caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the lower respiratory tract , but the mechanisms underlying infection remain poorly understood . The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, genetically closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) , has resulted in a global health emergency with longterm consequences on economics markets, nutritional habits, and mental and physical well-being . As information is still emerging about the health consequences of COVID-19, assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs) have been delayed due to fear of the unknown impact of SARS-Cov-2 on fertility . Fertility is compromised by age, and the longer treatments are delayed, the less likely that successful outcomes will be achieved . Furthermore, effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection increase in severity with host age , meaning that women of more advanced reproductive age undergoing ART could be at higher risk of infection. It is therefore critical to determine exactly how the virus affects reproductive physiology. Although the studies to date have been discordant, vertical transmission during pregnancy seems to occur infrequently, ranging from 0 to 11% . To date there is no information about how infection affects early implantation and development. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to damage tissue is determined by its capacity to enter and infect cells in that tissue . The SARS-CoV-2 entry point on the cell is angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) , which plays a key role in the renin-angiotensin system, cleaving angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. The system is disrupted after SARS-CoV-2 gains cell entry and down-regulates the expression of ACE2, leading to up-regulation of the proin flammatory response by angiotensin II . ACE2 exhibits moderately increased expression with age , which could explain disease severity in older people. Another path of entry, using Basigin (BSG) as receptor instead of ACE2, has been proposed . To enter the cell, SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike S protein to bind to ACE2, which leads to fusion with the cell membrane and endocytosis . TMPRSS2, a transmembrane protease, cleaves the S protein . Cleavage is necessary for the virus to bind to ACE2 and spread through the infected host . Other proteases are under investigation as possible implications in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity related to S protein cleaving. TMPRSS4 increased virus infectivity on its own, at least in gut epithelial cells , while cathepsins B and L (CTSB and CTSL, respectively) had residual cleaving activity of viral S protein in TMPRSS2- cells . FURIN, another protease predicted to cleave S protein, presents alongside ACE2 in epithelial layers of several oral mucosal tissues . MX dynamin-like GTPase 1 (MX1) regulates neutrophil infiltration, favoring infection through protein S modification by neutrophil elastase . The clinical presentation of COVID-19 ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe progressive pneumonia, gastrointestinal symptoms, fecal shedding, multiorgan failure, and even death , but few studies have focused on the virus’s effect on fertility and damage to reproductive tissues, or on concerns regarding the use of reproductive treatments. Leydig and Sertoli cells in the testis , oocytes , and ovarian tissue are likely to experience damage due to their medium-high expression of the ACE2 receptor. The endometrium is crucial for human reproduction and embryo implantation, but studies of the effect of SARSCoV-2 infection on menstrual cycle progression have not been performed. Delineating the virus’s impact on the tissue is important for determining risk to ART, given that a healthy endometrium is needed for embryo implantation and growth. The endometrium is a complex tissue subjected to a cycle of cell death and renewal approximately every 28 days . Numerous transcriptomic studies have sought to understand gene expression changes throughout the menstrual cycle , and most of these data sets are available in public repositories, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database . According to the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) , ACE transcript is in low abundance in endometrium and not present as protein. According to HPA expression levels, TMPRSS4 and FURIN RNA expression is low, and protein levels are medium, whereasCTSB, MX1, andBSG have medium RNA expression and high protein expression . However, there is little information on how the virus could affect endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation. We analyzed the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the endometrium by measuring endometrial ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, FURIN, MX1,a n dBSG gene expression. Transcriptomic data sets available across the phases of endometrial progression were used to evaluate molecularly the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",
       " 'Methods': 'MATERIALS AND METHODS Search and selection of SARS-CoV-2 infectivityrelated proteins A thorough literature search identified proteins related to the SARS-CoV-2 disease-causing mechanism, including genes related to cell entry and genes with implications in health and fertility, among others. The search for relevant genes associated with viral infectivity was made chronologically up to May 10, 2020. The keywords searched in PubMed included all possible combinations between‘‘SARS-CoV-2,’’ ‘‘COVID-19,’’ ‘‘coronavirus,’’ ‘‘cell entry mechanisms,’’ ‘‘long-term implications,’’and ‘‘fertility.’’ Search and selection of endometrial transcriptomic data sets Public transcriptomic data sets were used to analyze expression of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity-related genes throughout the menstrual cycle. Endometrial transcriptomic experiments for control patients (without any known endometrial pathology) were systematically searched in the GEO database with no restrictions on publication date or language and according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines . Keywords were: uter* OR endometr*,filtered by‘‘homo sapiens.’’Experiments were selected if /C15 RNA was extracted directly from human endometrial biopsies. /C15 Endometrial biopsies were collected at different times during the menstrual cycle. /C15 Cycle phase at the time of biopsy was available for all samples. /C15 Endometrial gene expression was evaluated by microarray or RNA sequencing using Affymetrix, Illumina, or Agilent platforms. /C15 Raw gene expression data were freely available to download from GEO. Preprocessing and integrative analysis Transcriptomic raw data were downloaded from the GEO database and processed according to the standards of the technology used (microarrays or RNA-seq) using limma R-package (version 3.34.9) . Expression data from each 224 VOL. 114 NO. 2 / AUGUST 2020 SEMINAL CONTRIBUTIONS experiment were annotated with biomaRt (version 2.30.0) , log transformed, and quantile normalized using limma . Principal components analysis (PCA) was done using the prcomp() function, and the scores were displayed using the ggplot2 R-package to look for possible batch effects and were corrected if using linear models. Outliers were deleted from posterior analysis if there was a distinct transcriptional behavior according to PCA. To integrate the included endometrial transcriptomic experiments, several steps were followed as recommended by Tajti et al. : after being independently normalized, selected studies were joined in a unique data set, and batch effects were corrected using linear models (limma R package) . A relative expression value of low, medium, and high expression were established. The thresholds respectively correspond to 1% to 10%, 11% to 50%, and 51% to 100% categories of gene expression values of the entire integrated data set. Pairwise differential expression analysis between experiments was performed using limma to identify genes with expression differences.P values were corrected using false discovery rates (FDR) , and genes differentially expressed between experiments were removed from the analysis (FDR<.05). Differential gene expression throughout the menstrual cycle An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for each selected gene related to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity to assess which genes showed statistically significant differences between endometrial phases. Analysis of variance was followed by a pairwiset-test to determine statistically significant differences between phases. Fold changes in gene expression from phase to phase were also calculated. The mean expression and confidence intervals for each gene in each phase were represented using ggplot2 R-package (version 3.0.0) . Coexpression of infectivity genes and the effect of age Pearson’s correlation was used to assess coexpression between each pair of selected proteins related to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and to analyze the effect of age (from 23 to 50 years) on the expression of each protein. All programming and statistical tests (t-test, Pearson’s correlation, and analysis of variance) were implemented in the R environment (version 3.4.4, 2018-03-15) .',\n",
       " 'Results': 'RESULTS Menstrual cycle clock in integrated endometrial data sets From a total of 694 studies retrieved from GEO, our search identified five unique studies that evaluated endometrial gene expression in women with normal endometrium, comprising 112 samples (Table 1; see Supplemental Fig. 1, available online, for detailed filtering steps). All studies were analyzed separately for correction of possible batch effects, and three samples were excluded from analysis (details in Supplemental Fig. 2, available online). A unique combined data set with a population of 109 patients was obtained, comprising 29 samples in the proliferative phase, 29 in the early secretory phase, 43 in the medium secretory phase, and eight in the late secretory phase (Table 1). The 109 samples were grouped depending on the experiment rather than by the menstrual cycle phase (Fig. 1A, left). To make data sets comparable after the integration of all samples, this batch effect was removed (Fig. 1A, right). The resulting gene expression samples showed a behavior based on menstrual cycle phases rather than study nature (Fig. 1B). Viral infectivity genes show a different expression landscape across the menstrual cycle The gene expression landscapes for each viral gene across the cycle are shown inFigure 2B. TMPRSS4, CTSL, CTSB, FURIN, MX1, and BSG were highly expressed throughout the cycle; TMPRSS2 was moderately expressed, andACE2 was low (Fig. 2A). Gene expression of viral proteins depended on menstrual cycle phase. CalculatedP values and adjustedP values are presented inSupplemental Fig. 3A(available online). All genes exceptTMPRSS2 (P1⁄4.053) had statistically significant changes in expression across the menstrual cycle (Fig. 2A). Specifically, the genes most affected by menstrual cycle progression (P<.0001) were ACE2, which increased expression from early secretory to midsecretory;TMPRSS4, whose expression increased from proliferative to midsecretory and from early secretory to midsecretory (P<.0001); CTSL and CTSB, which increased from early secretory to midsecretory (P<.0001); TMPRSS2 with decreased expression from proliferative to early secretory (P<.05); and BSG and FURIN, which increased from proliferative to midsecretory (P<.01) (Fig. 2A). All genes, including TMPRSS2, showed increased expression from early secretory to midsecretory, as indicated inSupplemental Figure 3B. Detailed expression changes across the menstrual cycle are provided for each gene inSupplemental Figure 4(available online). Correlations between genes showed activations and repressions between them throughout the menstrual cycle (Supplemental Table 1, available online).ACE2 and TMPRSS4 were positively correlated in the early secretory phase (0.58). A weak correlation (activation) was found for ACE2 with TMPRSS4 and CTSL in the window of implantation (0.17 and 0.25, respectively). Coactivations were also detected in the proliferative phase betweenCTSB and TMPRSS4; the early secretory phase betweenFURIN and BSG; the midsecretory phase between CTSB with CTSL,a n dMX1 with CTSB, CTSL,a n d TMPRSS4; and the late secretory phase betweenTMPRSS4 and CTSB, FURIN, CTSB,a n dCTSL. Based on our results, high coactivation values were prioritized to build a molecular scheme of SARS-CoV-2 plausible infection of the endometrium based on two mechanisms of entry: one viaACE2 receptor and the other via BSG receptor. This scheme is shown inFigure 2B. In this model,TMPRSS4, which is highly expressed in all phases of the menstrual cycle, especially during the window of implantation, is the protease responsible for protein S cleaving, giving SARS-CoV-2 the capacity to bind toACE2 and infect cells even ifACE2 is lowly expressed. The model adds CTSL, CTSB, and FURIN as novel actors in the SARSCoV-2 mechanism of cell entry. These proteases are highly VOL. 114 NO. 2 / AUGUST 2020 225 Fertility and Sterility® expressed and coactivate with TMPRSS4. They could also help with the cleaving of protein S in different sites, thereby increasing infectivity. We also includedMX1, which regulates neutrophil activity and is highly expressed, bringing neutrophils into the tissue with elastases to help cleave S protein. Finally, BSG, the alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2, also showed high expression, which would favor infectivity in this model, and activation withFURIN, which would favor infectivity in this model. Age influences the expression of viral genes throughout the menstrual cycle For this analysis, only samples from the study Talbi et al. were used because it was the only study that provided the age for each sample (in a range of 23-50 years old; n1⁄4 27). ACE2 showed increased expression with age in the proliferative, early secretory, and midsecretory phases (0.4, 0.73, 0.44, respectively; Fig. 3A). Most correlations by age were stronger in early phases of the menstrual cycle (proliferative and early secretory) than in subsequent endometrial stages (Fig. 3B). TMPRSS4 and MX1 were highly correlated with age in the early secretory phase;TMPRSS4, CTSL, andCTSB had positive correlation in the proliferative phase; andTMPRSS4 and BSG had positive correlation in the late secretory phase. In addition, high negative correlations were detected forBSG in the early secretory phase and forFURIN in the midsecretory phase.',\n",
       " 'Discussion': 'DISCUSSION It is important to understand the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection as the virus continues to spread worldwide. Fertility, specifically embryo implantation, is impacted by changes in endometrial gene expression throughout the menstrual cycle. Between menstrual cycle phases, gene expression varies to accompany physiologic changes . The differences in gene expression from one phase to another create a changing landscape for viral infection, and viral proteins themselves alter their expression throughout the menstrual cycle, setting the stage for a cyclical landscape of viral infectivity risk. ACE2, the receptor far for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, showed low expression in the endometrium in our study, as reported previously in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) . ACE2 is also reduced in critical tissues such as lungs ; TABLE 1 Characterization of endometrial transcriptomic data sets with GEO data sets identifier, experiment name given for this study, cycle type, method of cycle phase dating, population from which samples were collected, age, transcriptomic platform used to measure gene expression, number of genes of each data set, number of samples in each data set, number of samples per cycle phase, and publication in which data were initially employed.

COVID-19 effects on the endometrium. Fertil Steril 2020. 226 VOL. 114 NO. 2 / AUGUST 2020 SEMINAL CONTRIBUTIONS however, we cannot suggest that low levels ofACE2 expression imply no effect of the virus on the tissue. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effect of decreasedACE2 in the endometrium. It is interesting that ACE2 increased (fold change 1⁄4 2.47) from the early secretory to midsecretory phases, implying an increase inACE2 in the window of implantation and a high risk of viral infectivity at this stage of the menstrual cycle. Several possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry have been proposed . TMPRSS2, the most-reported protease involved with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity alongsideACE2, had medium endometrial expression in our study. However, there was no correlation betweenTMPRSS2, ACE2, and the rest of the genes studied. These results imply that the endometrium should be safe against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity mediated by TMPRSS2, though the expression of other proteases associated with S protein cleavage show a different landscape than TMPRSS2. TMPRSS4 statistically significantly changes its expression throughout the menstrual cycle, showing a statistically significant increase in the midsecretory phase. This protein also showed an interesting correlation with other genes, including an increase alongsideACE2 in the early secretory phase. Although TMPRSS2 is implicated in cell entry, the fact that S proteins could be targeted byTMPRSS4 and that TMPRSS4 increased infectivity in gut epithelial cells could mean a vulnerability of the endometrium to infection by SARS-CoV-2 mediated by TMPRSS4. Furthermore, TMPRSS4 up-regulation was correlated withCTSL and CTSB in all phases except the early secretory phase. Cell infection by SARS-CoV-2 was observed inTMRPSS2- cell lines expressing bothCTSL and CTSB, so these proteins may have a residual function of cleaving viral S protein . We propose that a synergy of CTSL and CTSB with TMPRSS4 through most of the cycle favors SARS-CoV-2 FIGURE 1 Endometrial data set integration and menstrual cycle clock.

Finally, TMPRSS4 was positively correlated with MX1 in the midsecretory phase.MX1 actively participates in SARSCoV-2 infection by attracting neutrophils to infected tissue and employing their elastases to cleave protein S along with TMPRSS2 ; if TMPRSS4 participates alongside MX1,a more severe infection could occur during the window of implantation. TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, FURIN, andMX1 showed statistically significant expression changes throughout the cycle. Protein expression of TMPRSS4, CTSB, FURIN, and MX1 supports a susceptible environment for infection in the early secretory and midsecretory phases. Future studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism of SARS-CoV2 cell entry and the roles ofTMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, FURIN, and MX1 in the endometrium. BSG, the alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry , showed high expression with statistically significant changes between phases and strong activation withFURIN through most of the cycle; however, its repression was correlated with ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Our results may indicate that only FURIN could be involved in S viral protein cleavage, if necessary, for SARS-CoV-2 binding toBSG, though other unknown proteases could also be involved. Further studies are needed to provide insight onBSG function in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the endometrium. We also investigated the effect of age on viral gene expression throughout the menstrual cycle. In a recent study FIGURE 3 Impact of age on viral-related infectivity gene expression throughout the menstrual cycle. (A) Effect of age onACE2 expression.

Fertil Steril 2020. VOL. 114 NO. 2 / AUGUST 2020 229 Fertility and Sterility® in lungs, ACE2 expression was detected as highly variable among individuals ranging from 0.17 transcripts per million to 14.5 transcripts per million in the same demographic group and highlighted a skewness of expression that statistically significantly increased with age . Our results showed a positive correlation between age andACE2 from the proliferative to midsecretory phases, especially in the early secretory phase, meaning that the endometrium in older women (to age 50) could be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. TMPRSS2 decreased with age, particularly in the midsecretory and late secretory phases, which may mean that cellmediated entry of the virus is lowered with increased age. However, TMPRSS4 increased in expression from the proliferative to early secretory phases similar toCTSB, CTSL, and MX1. These results, in conjunction with ACE2 expression changes, highlighted the same behavior related to age as in the lungs , implying a higher risk of endometrial infection in older women, especially in the early phases of the menstrual cycle, as well as potential implantation problems. However, our results are limited to only one study with 27 patients, and there are no prospective studies showing the real clinical implications. ACE2 plays an important role in endometrial changes because it cleaves angiotensin II and impacts spiral artery vasoconstriction, posterior proliferation, and renewal of tissue . ACE2 down-regulation by SARS-CoV-2 could alter the endometrial balance ; however, given that the landscape of the tissue is modified with each menstrual cycle renewal, the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be reset from cycle to cycle. Because our study integrates data sets from GEO, this approach is limited by the study design. This also means that results depend on the experimental transcriptomic procedures of prior reported results and the sample cohort included in each study. However, the inclusion criteria for the selected studies were very careful, and uniform and raw data were preprocessed to control undesired effects. Likewise, the virus differentially affects individuals due to each person’s genetic profile . Further prospective research is needed to determine the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the endometrium and how it could affect the fertility of each patient.',\n",
       " 'Conclusion': 'CONCLUSION Although TMPRSS2 expression implies a safe environment against infection, the roles of proteases and neutrophil regulating proteins TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, FURIN, and MX1 could imply susceptibility of infection, especially during the early secretory and midsecretory phases. Additionally, the high expression ofBSG could imply an alternative mechanism independent of ACE2 for endometrial viral infection. Our findings show that viral gene expression increases with age, suggesting that the endometrium of older women undergoing ART is at higher risk of viral infection. A careful approach is advised, with precautions implemented when resuming ART.',\n",

Other distinguished TFs that regulated up to 15 gene lists included AR, CEBPA, CEBPB, CEBPD, CREB1, EGR1, ELF3, ESR1, ETV4, FOS, FOXA1, GATA2, GATA3, GATA6, HNF4A, JUN, JUND, NFKB1, NR1H2, NR3C1, RELA, SMAD3, SP1, SPI1, STAT1, STAT3, TCF7L2, TFAP2C and TP53. Notably, GATA6 was selected due to novel association with endometrial progression and function. To infer the expression of CTCF and GATA6 in endometrial tissue throughout the menstrual cycle, we analysed their expression using a relevant endometrial dataset recently created by our group [30] (Table S1 ). We observed that, relative to the global expression of endometrial genes, CTCF was broadly expressed while GATA6 was moderately expressed. Indeed, CTCF was significantly down-regulated between the PF and ESE phases (FDR = 2.10E-03) and ESE to the MSE phase (FDR = 2.10E-04), while GATA6 expression increased from the PF to the MSE phase (FDR = 1.70E-11) and from the ESE to MSE phase (FDR = 9.80E-15).70E-11) and from the ESE to MSE phase (FDR = 9.80E-15). These findings supported the role of these TFs at the beginning of the menstrual cycle and during the MSE phase (Fig. 3 B). These in-silico validations were then prospectively corroborated by RT-qPCR analysis in an independent sample set of 20 endometrial biopsies. We observed a similar expression profile of CTCF and GATA6 throughout the menstrual cycle, with significant changes between the endometrial phases. Notably, CTCF expression was decreased between the PF/ ESE and MSE/LSE phases (FDR = 0.01) while GATA6 expression increased from the PF/ESE to MSE/LSE phases (FDR = 1.55E-04) (Fig. 3 C).\\n\\n']\n"

Unifying all the aforementioned signatures, we compiled 3,608 genes related to endometrial progression and function. Hormonal regulation of endometrial progression is largely driven by progesterone We identified 7,540 and 698 genes related to estrogen and progesterone hormones, respectively. However, as determined by the relative contribution of each type of hormone within each gene list (Fig. 1A), 17/19 (89%) signatures favoured regulation by progesterone rather than estrogen.

      "of a normal menstrual cycle. Consequently, this period \n",
      "of time is called the window of implantation (WOI) [3], \n",
      "and is characterized by abrupt transcriptomic changes \n",
      "in the endometrial tissue [4]. Alterations in either WOI \n",

       " {'text': 'This study revealed novel hormonal and non‑hormonal regulators and their relative contributions to endometrial progression and pathology, providing new leads for the potential causes of endometrial‑factor infertility. The endometrium is the innermost layer of the uterus, which undergoes dynamic histological, physiological and molecular changes that allow it to synchronize with embryo development, facilitate embryo implantation, and ultimately, establish a successful pregnancy. Implantation is a crucial and complex limiting step for conception which occurs between days 19 to 24 of a normal menstrual cycle. Consequently, this period of time is called the window of implantation (WOI) and is characterized by abrupt transcriptomic changes in the endometrial tissue. Alterations in either WOI establishment and endometrial progression may lead to implantation failures, which, along with biochemical miscarriage, account for more than 50% of pregnancy losses at pre-clinical stages. These alterations have broadly been classified as being related to a displaced WOI, caused by variable timing of endometrial progression, or a disrupted WOI, where impaired endometrial function prevents the establishment of an effective WOI. Initially, the WOI was postulated to mainly be regu -lated by the ovarian hormones (namely, estrogen and progesterone) acting via their respective nuclear receptors (i.e., ESR1/2 and PGR). However, evidence has shown that these receptors cooperate with other transcription factors (TFs) and co-regulators to mediate uterine physiology [8]. In fact, TFs (such as homeobox TFs, FOXA2, and KLF9) have recently been reported as key regulators for the establishment of endometrial receptivity [9, 10], and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to similarly intervene in this complex and multifactorial process as transcriptional regulators [11]. While the involvement of both types of regulators was widely reported in embryo implantation [12] and other infertility-related diseases, including recurrent implantation failure (RIF) [13], the complex interactions between the different types of regulators and their respective contributions to endometrial progression and function have not been investigated from a systemic point of view. This paradigm shift approaches genes and regulators in an integrative way, by considering how they interact with and coordinate each other to carry out cellular processes, rather than reinforcing the premise they work independently [14]. By more accurately reflecting the biological milieu, systemic approaches take gene-based discoveries to the next level.',\n",

Notwithstanding, the candidate biomarkers of endometrial receptivity reported in each of the aforementioned studies overlap poorly [7]. Indeed, recent comparisons conducted by Sebastian-Leon and colleagues [7] found no congruities between 16 different reported gene lists of endometrial receptivity, and only fair to moderate functional agreements between some of the included signatures.

Thus, the aim of this study was to utilize available genomic data regarding transcriptional regulators to identify overlapping mediators of endometrial transcriptional regulation (i.e., ovarian hormones, TFs, and miRNAs) and determine the relative contribution of each type of regulator among the previously reported gene signatures. These findings could help unveil the master regulators and principal type of endometrial regulation, paving the way for further research aimed at improving woman´s reproductive health.

Besides, some traditional molecular procedures such as PCRs are also performed to corroborate the insight uncovered with this approach. We highlighted a larger influence of progesterone-related genes and TFs in endometrial progression and observed a larger contribution of miRNAs and estrogen-related genes in endometrial pathology. Furthermore, we unveiled CTCF, GATA6, hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-218-5p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-103a-3p and hsa-miR-128-3p as master regulators in the endometrium, and these findings were reinforced by the dynamic changes in their expression throughout the menstrual cycle (dually validated with in-silico and prospective analyses). The menstrual cycle is perceived to be under tight regulation by the ovarian hormones, progesterone and estrogen [48]. Supporting the role of progesterone in the secretory endometrium [49], and reinforcing its indispensable role in endometrial regulation [50, 51], we found progesterone and its related genes had a larger influence in menstrual cycle progression than estrogen. As the RIF-related gene lists reported by Altmae2010 and Koot were generally controlled by estrogen, this further suggested that while progesterone could be crucial for a suitable endometrial progression and mid-secretory phase acquisition, estrogenic irregularities may be more conducive to endometrial function and molecular pathology. Indeed, this hypothesis corroborated previous reports of most uterine disorders being estrogen-dependent [44, 52]. Supporting the findings from another recent study from our group, where the Altmae2010 and Koot signatures were classified as highly-predictive signatures to identify endometrial pathology in comparison with a prediction model that detected endometrial progression [7 ]. This study distinguished these signatures (related to implantation failure and unexplained infertility) based on the magnitude of their miRNA and estrogen-regulation, which contrasted with the prominent influence of the TFs over the remaining signatures more related to endometrial progression. All these facts reinforce the hypothesis that implantation failure is mainly caused by impaired miRNA expression [53].',\n",

CTCF is a conserved zinc finger protein whose regulatory functions are well characterized throughout the human body [64]. CTCF acts as a transcriptional repressor in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing and imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation [65], as well as an insulator, blocking the interaction between enhancers and the promoters of neighbouring genes [66]. Considering these attributed functions and its variable expression throughout the menstrual cycle, we propose that CTCF exerts an inhibitory role in endometrial tissue during the PF phase of the menstrual cycle. With the significant downregulation of CTCF in the secretory endometrium, dually validated in-silico and experimentally herein, its inhibited genes would be derepressed and become transcriptionally active during the WOI. This interpretation supports previous findings from our group demonstrating that, during the WOI, a global transcriptional derepression may be required for implantation and early embryo development [63]. Transcriptional derepression has been associated with multiple human disease states and should be investigated further within the context of endometrial-factor infertility. Despite previous associations of CTCF with endometriosis [67], its implication in endometrial progression and function has not been directly proposed until now. Nevertheless, the role of CTCF in endometrial receptivity has been revealed through its interaction with HOXA10, a gene mainly expressed in endometrium involved in functions such as endometrial proliferation and differentiation, the formation of pinopodes or embryo implantation [68]. Indeed, this study proposed that an overexpression of CTCF can lead to a drop in HOXA10 expression, affecting endometrial proliferation and endometrial function and corroborating the fact that CTCF must decrease its expression as we can observe in our findings. GATA6, the second prioritized TF that overlapped across the gene lists, is a transcription factor belonging to the GATA family, a highly conserved family of six zinc finger proteins [69]. Besides its essential role in embryonic development [70], GATA6 plays a key role in endometriosis and regulates steroidogenic genes [71]. Together with evidence supporting both an activating and inhibitory role for GATA6 [72, 73], the significant changes we observed in its expression across the menstrual cycle reflect its presumed involvement in the endometrium and suggest an activating role in endometrial progression and endometrial receptivity acquisition. Like CTCF, this is the first time that GATA6 is proposed as a key TF in endometrial progression and function.',\n",

Despite this fact, we have found that our holistic approach overcomes this undesired variability effect by finding common upstream master regulators across studies and predicting new relationships between hormones, TFs and miRNAs. This approach also provides the basis for future single-molecule studies that aim to elucidate new regulatory pathways in endometrial progression and function. Our results lay the foundation for further molecular studies that can validate the function(s) of the prevailing endometrial regulators we prioritized. The study shows for the first time, the relative contribution of estrogens, progesterone, TFs and miRNAs in endometrial function and progression. Endometrial progression is mainly influenced by progesterone-related genes and TFs, whereas miRNAs and estrogen-related genes play a larger role in endometrial pathology. Moreover, we highlight novel common transcriptional regulators such as CTCF, GATA6, hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-218-5p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-103a-3p, and hsa-miR-128-3p across 19 studies that propose biomarkers in endometrial regulation.

      "This study revealed novel hormonal and non‑hormonal regulators and their relative contributions to endometrial progression and pathology, providing new leads for the potential causes of endometrial‑factor infertility. The endometrium is the innermost layer of the uterus, which undergoes dynamic histological, physiological and molecular changes that allow it to synchronize with embryo development, facilitate embryo implantation, and ultimately, establish a successful pregnancy. Implantation is a crucial and complex limiting step for conception which occurs between days 19 to 24 of a normal menstrual cycle. Consequently, this period of time is called the window of implantation (WOI) and is characterized by abrupt transcriptomic changes in the endometrial tissue. Alterations in either WOI establishment and endometrial progression may lead to implantation failures, which, along with biochemical miscarriage, account for more than 50% of pregnancy losses at pre-clinical stages. These alterations have broadly been classified as being related to a displaced WOI, caused by variable timing of endometrial progression, or a disrupted WOI, where impaired endometrial function prevents the establishment of an effective WOI. Initially, the WOI was postulated to mainly be regu -lated by the ovarian hormones (namely, estrogen and progesterone) acting via their respective nuclear receptors (i.e., ESR1/2 and PGR). However, evidence has shown that these receptors cooperate with other transcription factors (TFs) and co-regulators to mediate uterine physiology [8]. In fact, TFs (such as homeobox TFs, FOXA2, and KLF9) have recently been reported as key regulators for the establishment of endometrial receptivity [9, 10], and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to similarly intervene in this complex and multifactorial process as transcriptional regulators [11]. While the involvement of both types of regulators was widely reported in embryo implantation [12] and other infertility-related diseases, including recurrent implantation failure (RIF) [13], the complex interactions between the different types of regulators and their respective contributions to endometrial progression and function have not been investigated from a systemic point of view. This paradigm shift approaches genes and regulators in an integrative way, by considering how they interact with and coordinate each other to carry out cellular processes, rather than reinforcing the premise they work independently [14]. By more accurately reflecting the biological milieu, systemic approaches take gene-based discoveries to the next level.\n",
      "Previous studies of endometrial transcriptomics have been used to define the WOI, compare the endometrium of healthy women as their menstrual cycles progressed [4, 17–19]; address endometrial differences related to age [20] or the dysfunction of the WOI between patients with implantation failure and healthy controls [21]; and finally, correct for the menstrual cycle bias that can mask important biomarkers [22]. Notwithstanding, the candidate biomarkers of endometrial receptivity reported in each of the aforementioned studies overlap poorly [7]. Indeed, recent comparisons conducted by Sebastian-Leon and colleagues [7] found no congruities between 16 different reported gene lists of endometrial receptivity, and only fair to moderate functional agreements between some of the included signatures. Despite previous transcriptional regulation studies, there have been no holistic studies of endometrial receptivity.\n",
      "fair to moderate functional agreements between some of the included signatures. Despite previous transcriptional regulation studies, there have been no holistic studies of this regulatory process, which robustly analyse the drivers of transcription across a higher number of studies (that each searched for endometrial receptivity biomarkers) and map the relative contributions of each type of regulator to endometrial progression regulation (Ovarian hormones [i.e., estrogen, progesterone], TFs, miRNAs). Thus, the aim of this study was to utilize available genomic data regarding transcriptional regulators to identify overlapping mediators of endometrial transcriptional regulation (i.e., ovarian hormones, TFs, and miRNAs) and determine the relative contribution of each type of regulator among the previously reported gene signatures. These findings could help unveil the master regulators and principal type of endometrial regulation, paving the way for further research aimed at improving woman´s reproductive health. Annotating gene lists associated with endometrial progression and function. Endometrial progression and implantation failure gene lists [7] were retrieved and updated using a public data repository (i.e., Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)).\n",
      "To study the hormonal regulation of endometrial progression, the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [24], and Gene Ontology (GO) [25] databases were consulted for ovarian hormone-related genes, using relevant keywords (i.e., progesterone, estrogen, oestrogen and estradiol) and selecting those pathways and functions that contained them (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Genes associated with the obtained human KEGG pathways and GO functions were grouped according to whether they were unique to progesterone (P4 gene set) or estrogen (E2 gene set) or related to both hormones (P4 and E2 gene set). Gene targets of the nuclear progesterone (PGR) and estrogen (ESR1, ESR2) receptors were added to their corresponding gene sets using DoRothEA (Discriminant Regulon Expression Analysis) database [26], considering only manually-curated or ChiP-Seq experimentally-validated gene-TF relationships. Finally, the P4 and E2 gene sets were independently mapped to each gene list.\n",

      "We built regulatory networks to systemically analyse endometrial regulation. Nodes represented gene lists and regulators (miRNAs or TFs), while edges indicated significant enrichment among the lists and their corresponding regulators (false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05). To select the most influential regulators (i.e., those which targeted genes in most of our signatures), we studied the degree distribution of the networks (i.e., the number of gene lists regulated by each molecule) and prioritized the miRNAs and TFs which surpassed the relative maximum (i.e., 1.50 times the interquartile range (IQR)) number of relationships (gene list–regulators). All networks were built and analysed with Cytoscape version 3.7 [28] (Supplementary Fig. S1B). To evaluate how the miRNAs’ expression change in the endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle, we used the raw data from GSE44558 GEO dataset [29], deriving from 20 endometrial samples collected throughout the menstrual cycle: four in early-proliferative (EPF), four in late-proliferative (LPF), four in early-secretory (ESE), four in mid-secretory (MSE) and four in late-secretory (LSE). To evaluate how the TFs’ expression change in the endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle, we analysed the integrated endometrial dataset previously created by our group, and reported in [30], which compiled data from five prior publications (GSE98386, GSE29981, GSE4888, GSE119209 and GSE86491).

      "mentioned signatures, we compiled 3,608 genes related to endometrial progression and function. Hormonal regulation of endometrial progression is largely driven by progesterone. We identified 7,540 and 698 genes related to estrogen and progesterone hormones, respectively. However, as determined by the relative contribution of each type of hormone within each gene list (Fig. 1A), 17/19 (89%) signatures favoured regulation by progesterone rather than estrogen. These differences were significant in 47% of the signatures (FDR < 0.05). Exceptionally, the genes reported by the Altmae2010 and Koot signatures, that were related to unexplained infertility and RIF, had a preference for estrogen regulation (Fig. 1A).

Significantly more genes were targeted by hormonally-influenced regulators rather than non-hormonal regulators (P -value < 0.01, odds ratio =  91.94).

      "This data-driven approach exposed the common transcriptional regulators among 19 studies who proposed variable biomarkers of endometrial progression and function. In this study, we focused on understanding the relative contribution of both the hormonal and non-hormonal regulation, from an alternative holistic perspective. We applied data-driven hypothesis research that, unlike the traditional scientific method, allowed us to generate new hypotheses based on all available biologically-relevant knowledge [16], observing the molecular relationships from a wider scale view. Besides, some traditional molecular procedures such as PCRs are also performed to corroborate the insight uncovered with this approach. We highlighted a larger influence of progesterone-related genes and TFs in endometrial progression and observed a larger contribution of miRNAs and estrogen-related genes in endometrial pathology. Furthermore, we unveiled CTCF, GATA6, hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-218-5p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-103a-3p and hsa-miR-128-3p as master regulators in the endometrium, and these findings were reinforced by the dynamic changes in their expression throughout the menstrual cycle (dually validated with in-silico and prospective analyses). The menstrual cycle is perceived to be under tight regulation by the ovarian hormones, progesterone and estrogen [48]. Supporting the role of progesterone in the secretory endometrium [49], and reinforcing its indispensable role in endometrial regulation [50, 51], we found progesterone and its related genes had a larger influence in menstrual cycle progression than estrogen. As the RIF-related gene lists reported by Altmae2010 and Koot were generally controlled by estrogen, this further suggested that while progesterone could be crucial for a suitable endometrial progression and mid-secretory phase acquisition, estrogenic irregularities may be more conducive to endometrial function and molecular pathology. Indeed, this hypothesis corroborated previous reports of most uterine disorders being estrogen-dependent [44, 52]. Supporting the findings from another recent study from our group, where the Altmae2010 and Koot signatures were classified as highly-predictive signatures to identify endometrial pathology in comparison with a prediction model that detected endometrial progression [7 ]. This study distinguished these signatures (related to implantation failure and unexplained infertility) based on the magnitude of their miRNA and estrogen-regulation, which contrasted with the prominent influence of the TFs over the remaining signatures more related to endometrial progression. All these facts reinforce the hypothesis that implantation failure is mainly caused by impaired miRNA expression [53].\n",
      "This study transcended the simplistic paradigm of the bihormonal regulation of endometrial function by identifying a plethora of mediators, including 595 miRNAs and 311 TFs, that were previously unrelated to these ovarian hormones. These findings set the foundation for new discoveries, revealing alternative pathways and new actors in the regulation of the human endometrium, and deepening our understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms behind endometrial progression and unexplained infertility. MicroRNAs are well known to be involved in embryo implantation and receptivity control. Using network analysis, we unveiled the 10 common miRNAs regulating endometrial progression and function across published biomarker signatures (hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-103a-3p, hsa-miR-128-3p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-218-5p, hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-27b-3p, hsa-miR-424-5p, and has-let-7b-5p).\n",

      "endometrial progression and function were beyond the scope of this project and merit further investigation. CTCF is a conserved zinc finger protein whose regulatory functions are well characterized throughout the human body [64]. CTCF acts as a transcriptional repressor in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing and imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation [65], as well as an insulator, blocking the interaction between enhancers and the promoters of neighbouring genes [66]. Considering these attributed functions and its variable expression throughout the menstrual cycle, we propose that CTCF exerts an inhibitory role in endometrial tissue during the PF phase of the menstrual cycle. With the significant downregulation of CTCF in the secretory endometrium, dually validated in-silico and experimentally herein, its inhibited genes would be derepressed and become transcriptionally active during the WOI. This interpretation supports previous findings from our group demonstrating that, during the WOI, a global transcriptional derepression may be required for implantation and early embryo development [63]. Transcriptional derepression has been associated with multiple human disease states and should be investigated further within the context of endometrial-factor infertility. Despite previous associations of CTCF with endometriosis [67], its implication in endometrial progression and function has not been directly proposed until now. Nevertheless, the role of CTCF in endometrial receptivity has been revealed through its interaction with HOXA10, a gene mainly expressed in endometrium involved in functions such as endometrial proliferation and differentiation, the formation of pinopodes or embryo implantation [68]. Indeed, this study proposed that an overexpression of CTCF can lead to a drop in HOXA10 expression, affecting endometrial proliferation and endometrial function and corroborating the fact that CTCF must decrease its expression as we can observe in our findings. GATA6, the second prioritized TF that overlapped across the gene lists, is a transcription factor belonging to the GATA family, a highly conserved family of six zinc finger proteins [69]. Besides its essential role in embryonic development [70], GATA6 plays a key role in endometriosis and regulates steroidogenic genes [71]. Together with evidence supporting both an activating and inhibitory role for GATA6 [72, 73], the significant changes we observed in its expression across the menstrual cycle reflect its presumed involvement in the endometrium and suggest an activating role in endometrial progression and endometrial receptivity acquisition. Like CTCF, this is the first time that GATA6 is proposed as a key TF in endometrial progression and function.\n",
      "endometrial regulation remain elusive, emerging experimental technologies such as High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (Hi-C) or chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tags (ChIA-PET) that respectively study general chromatin interactions or chromatin interactions involving a specific protein [74, 75] may improve our understanding of genetic regulation in the future. Nevertheless, as collaborative efforts unveil new regulators and gene targets in humans (such as the ENCODE project [76]), the complexities of transcriptional regulation can be exposed by in-silico analyses like those described herein, and we can gain a better understanding of the processes involved in menstrual cycle progression and endometrial competence. Furthermore, it should be noted that results of gene expression studies are influenced by different variables, such as the experimental platforms employed, study designs, or patients’ characteristics of each independent\n",
      "expression studies are influenced by different variables, such as the experimental platforms employed, study designs, or patients’ characteristics of each independent study, adding variability [30, 77, 78]. Despite this fact, we have found that our holistic approach overcomes this undesired variability effect by finding common upstream master regulators across studies and predicting new relationships between hormones, TFs and miRNAs. This approach also provides the basis for future single-molecule studies that aim to elucidate new regulatory pathways in endometrial progression and function. Our results lay the foundation for further molecular studies that can validate the function(s) of the prevailing endometrial regulators we prioritized. The study shows for the first time, the relative contribution of estrogens, progesterone, TFs and miRNAs in endometrial function and progression. Endometrial progression is mainly influenced by progesterone-related genes and TFs, whereas miRNAs and estrogen-related genes play a larger role in endometrial pathology. Moreover, we highlight novel common transcriptional regulators such as CTCF, GATA6, hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-218-5p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-103a-3p, and hsa-miR-128-3p across 19 studies that propose biomarkers in endometrial regulation. These results reveal the molecular mechanism underlying endometrial regulation and lay the foundation for the development of targeted therapies for patients with endometrial-factor infertility.\n",
      "We reviewed 19 publications related to endometrial progression and function, extracted the gene signatures from the original publication, and created corresponding gene lists that we could annotate. We performed different functional analyses based on the type of regulator (i.e., ovarian hormones, transcription factors and miRNAs). We used online databases to obtain the information of the regulatory process, at the hormonal (Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Dorothea), transcription factor (Dorothea) and miRNA (Tarbase) level and analysed the results accordingly. Finally, we employed an integrative analysis and prioritized the most relevant regulators for subsequent validation. TF, Transcription factors; miRNA, microRNA.\n",

      "Single cell technologies are expanding our understanding of endometriosis and adenomyosis, sister disorders of the uterine endometrium that contain similar complements of lesion cell types but located in different niches – outside and inside the endometrium, respectively. Both diseases cause significant morbidity and impaired quality of life among those affected, and current therapies mitigate most symptoms although with highly variable efficacy, duration of effect, and frequent intolerable side effects. Thus, there is a pressing need for transformative approaches to develop individualized therapies for the variety of presentations of endometriosis and adenomyosis symptoms and heterogeneity of lesion types histologically and architecturally. Single cell technologies are transforming understanding human physiology and pathophysiology in the reproductive system and beyond. This manuscript reviews endometriosis and adenomyosis clinical characteristics and the recent studies focused on eutopic endometrium and ectopic lesions at single cell resolution, the myriad of cell types and subtypes, cell-cell communications, signaling pathways, applications for novel drug discovery and therapeutic approaches, and challenges and opportunities that accompany this type of research.\n",

      "Key take-home messages from the studies reviewed herein include:\n",
      "Evidence strongly supports that superficial and deep endometriosis are related and are distinct entities from ovarian endometriomas, challenging a “one size fits all” approach to these lesions.\n",
      "In the eutopic endometrium from endometriosis patients, there are epithelial abnormalities during the window of implantation, which can compromise fertility, including undetectable progesterone-regulated genes (PAEP and CXCL14), and endometrial subcellular alterations across the cycle that can affect tissue homeostasis, as observed in patients with disease.\n",
      "Menstrual endometrium (as a “liquid biopsy” of the tissue) mimics many of the abnormalities in the late secretory phase of patients with endometriosis, including aberrant progesterone signaling in the stromal fibroblasts, which are key to pregnancy establishment and endometrial shedding and regeneration.\n",
      "Superficial peritoneal endometriosis lesions display basalis epithelial stem cell markers, supporting the role of this tissue compartment in pelvic disease origins.\n",
      "Fibroblasts and immune cells are key contributors to the pro-inflammatory, angiogenic environment in ovarian endometriomas, opening new opportunities for drug discovery.\n",
      "Data from superficial lesions from patients on progestins reveal a unique perivascular cell type with features promoting neoangiogenesis and immune cell trafficking, and an immunotolerant microenvironment consistent with escape from immune clearance and conducive to lesion establishment. These results are remarkable, given progestin exposure of the lesions analyzed - thus raising the question of how efficacious such treatments are in curbing disease progression.\n",
      "The eutopic endometrium from adenomyosis uteri reveal that pericyte progenitors differentiate to steroid hormone receptor positive fibroblasts and to ciliated epithelial cells. The latter strongly supports mesenchymal-epithelial transition in this tissue, opening possible new therapeutic targets.\n",
      "In adenomyosis lesions, fibroblasts do not originate from pericyte progenitors and differentiate to fibroblasts expressing extracellular matrix components and to smooth muscle cells, suggesting these cells lead to the fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy observed clinically.\n",
      "Adenomyosis ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells and fibroblast-like cells displayed abnormal progesterone signaling. In addition, involvement of the WNT signaling pathway in epithelial populations opens new avenues for drug discovery for this disorder.\n",
      "Direct comparison of cell types in endometriosis and adenomyosis lesions is the next step of understanding these sister disorders.\n",
      "We conclude the review with an eye to the future – what Alice might see beyond the single-cell looking glass that connects endometrium and endometrial disorders with the trillions of cells of other tissues and organs in health and disease throughout the human body and the opportunities for novel diagnostic modalities and drug discovery for endometriosis, adenomyosis and related uterine and inflammatory conditions.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Endometriosis and adenomyosis are common estrogen-driven uterine disorders derived mainly from the basalis endometrium, characterized by “ectopic” endometrial-like cells outside their normal location. A key feature distinguishing them is the location of the ectopic lesions. For endometriosis they are outside the uterus - mostly in the pelvis and invading pelvic organs\n",
      "1\n",
      "–\n",
      "4\n",
      ", and for adenomyosis they are within the uterine myometrium\n",
      "5\n",
      "–\n",
      "8\n",
      ". Endometriosis and adenomyosis disease lesions comprise similar phenotypic endometrial epithelium and mesenchymal cell types and display characteristics of inflammation, neoneuroangiogenesis, and fibrosis\n",
      "1\n",
      "–\n",
      "9\n",
      ". However, whether their cellular features are equivalent in different anatomic niches is unknown and is of importance for disease stratification in view of the vastly heterogeneous lesion architectural structures and for developing tailored, personalized, patient-specific treatments and prognostic disease outcome indicators.\n",
      "These complex “sister” conditions often occur concomitantly\n",
      "10\n",
      "and result in similar symptoms of pain and uterine bleeding treated medically (mostly hormonal) with variable efficacies and are associated with infertility and similar poor reproductive outcomes\n",

      "14\n",
      "–\n",
      "18\n",
      ". Given the devastating impact of these disorders and limited success of effective therapies and disease prevention and cure, a transformative approach to disease phenotyping and novel, personalized therapeutics is essential to improve the lives of millions of patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis across the globe.\n",
      "Single cell technologies and precision medicine approaches are early in their application to these disorders and are beginning to provide insights into commonalities/differences of cell types in endometriosis, adenomyosis, and eutopic endometrium, and the role of their unique anatomical niches influencing cell behavior, disease establishment and pathophysiology. Moreover, single cell data and associated signaling pathways are anticipated to lead to novel drug candidate discovery to control symptoms, minimize disease burden resulting ultimately in cure, identifying diagnostic biomarkers, and informing disease classification and prognostics for disease courses. The time is now to move the needle on both disorders through single cell “glasses”!\n",

These studies underscore heterogeneity of specific cell types and altered features in different hormonal states across the menstrual cycle and provide a key backdrop to studies at the single cell level of endometrium of patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis, endometriosis lesions, and adenomyosis lesions. Herein, we begin with an overview of clinical characteristics of endometriosis and adenomyosis (sister disorders but not identical twins), followed by a summary of current advances in scRNA sequencing data of endometriosis and adenomyosis disease lesions, corresponding eutopic endometrium, control endometrium, and disease-specific and common cell features across tissues. We conclude with a review of challenges of conducting research on human tissues, especially those that are steroid hormone responsive, and how these data inform looking to the future through single cell glasses.\n",

These included motility, proliferation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and cancer, consistent with the theory of collective cell migration and invasion into the myometrium of endometrial-derived cells. The novel data set revealed vascular mimicry (important in tumor formation) and epithelial transformation to endothelial cells.

      ", there are some unique challenges and opportunities in studying the steroid-hormone responsive human uterine compartments and their associated disorders. All research on human tissues, obtained under approved IRB protocols and written informed consent, requires accurate information about the study cohorts (cases and controls) to minimize confounders and maximize data accuracy and interpretation. Key are well annotated, de-identified patient metadata - e.g., demographics (age, race/ethnicity, BMI), pregnancy history, family history, personal habits, indication for surgical procedure, medical and surgical histories, current hormonal and nonhormonal medications, supplements, co-morbidities, the surgical procedure in which tissue samples were acquired, histologic confirmation that samples contain relevant tissues/cells (e.g., endometrium, myometrium, EMJ, endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibrosis, other), and hormonal status at the time of sampling, documented in a comprehensive database. Acquiring such information and processing samples for sequencing and data management demand teams of experienced study directors, clinical, surgical, laboratory, and pathology colleagues and services, genomics and sequencing cores, laboratory staff, clinical research coordinators, data entry staff, biostatisticians, and computational scientists. Some challenges and opportunities regarding studies specifically on the female reproductive tract are described below.\n",
      "The hormonal status of cases and controls whose tissues are under study is critical in studies on endometrium, endometriosis, and adenomyosis, as these tissues are estrogen- and progesterone-responsive. The context of the steroid hormone milieu (cycle phase, hormonal medications, pre- and post-menopausal status) is essential for data analysis and interpretation. If patients are not using hormonal preparations, then menstrual cycle phase determination must distinguish the estrogen-dominant proliferative phase and the sub-phases of the progesterone-dominant secretory phase\n",

Cohort studies restricted to a single menstrual cycle phase avoid hormonal confounders due to similar hormonal environments of the samples\n",
      "in situ\n",
      "at the time of acquisition. Also, precise timing is key, as the endometrial and endometriosis and/or adenomyosis lesion transcriptomes may change within a given cycle phase (e.g., early vs late secretory phase and, strikingly, at the opening of the implantation window in normal patients without disease\n",
      "19\n",

Age of the lesions is largely unknown, and thus comparing a lesion “type” within the same patient or between patients may be affected by different temporal histories of the lesions.

       " 'Abstract': 'Single cell technologies are expanding our understanding of endometriosis and adenomyosis, sister disorders of the uterine endometrium that contain similar complements of lesion cell types but located in different niches – outside and inside the endometrium, respectively. Both diseases cause significant morbidity and impaired quality of life among those affected, and current therapies mitigate most symptoms although with highly variable efficacy, duration of effect, and frequent intolerable side effects. Thus, there is a pressing need for transformative approaches to develop individualized therapies for the variety of presentations of endometriosis and adenomyosis symptoms and heterogeneity of lesion types histologically and architecturally. Single cell technologies are transforming understanding human physiology and pathophysiology in the reproductive system and beyond. This manuscript reviews endometriosis and adenomyosis clinical characteristics and the recent studies focused on eutopic endometrium and ectopic lesions at single cell resolution, the myriad of cell types and subtypes, cell-cell communications, signaling pathways, applications for novel drug discovery and therapeutic approaches, and challenges and opportunities that accompany this type of research.',\n",
       " 'Introduction': 'Endometriosis and adenomyosis are common estrogen-driven uterine disorders derived mainly from the basalis endometrium, characterized by “ectopic” endometrial-like cells outside their normal location. A key feature distinguishing them is the location of the ectopic lesions. For endometriosis they are outside the uterus - mostly in the pelvis and invading pelvic organs 1 – 4 , and for adenomyosis they are within the uterine myometrium 5 – 8 . Endometriosis and adenomyosis disease lesions comprise similar phenotypic endometrial epithelium and mesenchymal cell types and display characteristics of inflammation, neoneuroangiogenesis, and fibrosis 1 – 9 . However, whether their cellular features are equivalent in different anatomic niches is unknown and is of importance for disease stratification in view of the vastly heterogeneous lesion architectural structures and for developing tailored, personalized, patient-specific treatments and prognostic disease outcome indicators.\\nThese complex “sister” conditions often occur concomitantly 10 and result in similar symptoms of pain and uterine bleeding treated medically (mostly hormonal) with variable efficacies and are associated with infertility and similar poor reproductive outcomes 1 , 4 – 13 . They also greatly impact quality of life of those affected 14 – 18 . Given the devastating impact of these disorders and limited success of effective therapies and disease prevention and cure, a transformative approach to disease phenotyping and novel, personalized therapeutics is essential to improve the lives of millions of patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis across the globe.\\nSingle cell technologies and precision medicine approaches are early in their application to these disorders and are beginning to provide insights into commonalities/differences of cell types in endometriosis, adenomyosis, and eutopic endometrium, and the role of their unique anatomical niches influencing cell behavior, disease establishment and pathophysiology. Moreover, single cell data and associated signaling pathways are anticipated to lead to novel drug candidate discovery to control symptoms, minimize disease burden resulting ultimately in cure, identifying diagnostic biomarkers, and informing disease classification and prognostics for disease courses. The time is now to move the needle on both disorders through single cell “glasses”!\\nRegarding endometrium, an atlas of normal, cycling endometrium has been derived at single cell resolution by several groups 19 – 22 (also see Chapter 3). These studies underscore heterogeneity of specific cell types and altered features in different hormonal states across the menstrual cycle and provide a key backdrop to studies at the single cell level of endometrium of patients with endometriosis and adenomyosis, endometriosis lesions, and adenomyosis lesions. Herein, we begin with an overview of clinical characteristics of endometriosis and adenomyosis (sister disorders but not identical twins), followed by a summary of current advances in scRNA sequencing data of endometriosis and adenomyosis disease lesions, corresponding eutopic endometrium, control endometrium, and disease-specific and common cell features across tissues. We conclude with a review of challenges of conducting research on human tissues, especially those that are steroid hormone responsive, and how these data inform looking to the future through single cell glasses.\\nEndometriosis and adenomyosis – sister disorders, not identical twins\\nEndometriosis and adenomyosis lesions both comprise uterine endometrial cells found outside their normal location ( Figure 1 ). For endometriosis, these cells form lesions - mostly in the pelvis - arriving mainly by retrograde menstruation and causing a profound inflammatory response 1 – 4 . Risks of developing endometriosis are ~ 50% genetic and ~50% environmental 2 , 4 . In contrast, adenomyosis-associated endometrial cells (epithelium and stroma) are found within the uterus – in the uterine myometrium – where they induce a local inflammatory response, smooth muscle hypertrophy and often an enlarged, globular uterus 5 – 8 . Risks of developing adenomyosis are multi-parity, prior uterine surgery, adult exposure to tamoxifen, and in utero exposures to estrogens 5 , 7 , 23 . Endometriosis has been more extensively studied due to ease of obtaining endometrial tissue and sampling disease lesions at surgery. Adenomyosis has had far less molecular, genetic, and genomic analyses, as uterine myometrial lesions and the endometrial-myometrial junction are accessible mainly from hysterectomy specimens, although the eutopic endometrium proper has been studied in adenomyosis patients due to ease of access by office biopsy.\\nFigure 1. Open in a new tab Comparison of endometriosis and adenomyosis pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnostic approaches, pathophysiology, symptoms, and therapies. Adapted from Bulun et al, 2023 9 , with permission.\\nDespite their differences in anatomic location, the two disorders share common origins, some molecular characteristics, symptoms, and treatment strategies 5 – 9 , 12 ( Figure 1 ). Both are diseases of the basalis endometrium with collective cell migration out of the uterus into the pelvis or into the muscle that may also involve epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition 5 , 6 , 9 . They share postulated origins of Mullerian remnant transformation and differentiation of endometrial stem/progenitor cells, and some common epithelial cancer driver mutations although they rarely transform into cancers 6 , 9 . They are estrogen-dependent, progesterone (P 4 )-resistant disorders, display increased estradiol (E 2 ) production in disease (due to aberrant aromatase expression in the epithelium and some stromal cells) and decreased E 2 metabolism and conversion to testosterone 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 23 , 25 , 26 . Both are also inflammatory disorders and have the activated inflammasome as the final common pathway for local and systemic inflammation 2 , 3 , 27 . And both can be induced in the developing fetus and/or adult (in animal models) and are associated in humans with endocrine disrupting chemicals found in the environment and personal care products 23 .\\nEndometriosis and adenomyosis share similar clinical features ( Figure 1 ) including dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and poor pregnancy outcomes, and they often co-exist in the same patient and relapse post fertility-preserving surgery 5 – 7 , 9 , 12 , 28 . Symptom histories are key in diagnosing both disorders, but many symptoms overlap between them and with other disorders 2 , 4 . Standards for endometriosis and adenomyosis diagnosis are histologic confirmation of endometrial-like cells in lesions, and pelvic MRI and transvaginal ultrasound are useful for detecting endometriomas and deep disease as well as adenomyosis-associated widened endometrial-myometrial junction and adenomyomas 4 , 29 .\\nTreatment paradigms are similar for both disorders and include combined estrogen/ progestin contraceptive steroids, progestins alone, progestin-containing intrauterine systems, selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs), selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), GnRH analogs, aromatase inhibitors accompanied by ovulation suppression, and dopamine agonists, and medically assisted and advanced reproductive technologies for infertility 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 . Overall, medical therapies for pain have limited efficacy and/or intolerability for many patients. Endometriosis lesion removal or hysterectomy is largely effective for symptom management, although ~ 50% of patients recur within 5 years after conservative surgery and ~15% after hysterectomy 1 , 4 , 12 . Adenomyosis, on the other hand, can be excised but this is rarely performed due to technical challenges, and while hysterectomy is curative, it compromises fertility pursuits 30 .\\nThus, developing non-invasive diagnostics as stand-alone assessments or as adjuncts to imaging technologies, and innovative and personalized therapies are major goals for both disorders.',\n",

       " 'Results': 'Endometriosis through single cell glasses Subsequent to the single cell cartography of human endometrium published by Wang et al 19 (see Chapter 3), several groups have recently reported eutopic endometrial scRNAseq data of patients with endometriosis, endometriosis lesions and control eutopic endometrium 20 , 31 – 36 ( Table 1 ). Types of samples, inclusion/exclusion criteria, choice of controls, study designs, numbers of cells sequenced, and number of reads (i.e., base pairs sequenced) are key to data integrity and interpretation and to comparative analyses across tissues and studies. They have provided insights into origins of ectopic disease, the heterogeneity of cell types/subtypes, unique clusters and signatures of endometrium and ectopic lesions informing mechanisms and pathways involved in cellular dysfunctions relevant to pain and fertility compromise, novel cell-cell communications, relationships between lesions and eutopic tissue/cells, and biomarker discovery. Across these studies, samples were obtained in different hormonal milieu (menstrual cycle phase, exogenous hormones), and between 55,000 to 378,000 cells were sequenced ( Table 1 ). As cycle phase and exogenous hormone use are key drivers of endometrial gene expression 37 – 44 , comparison of data across studies can be challenging and mixed hormonal milieu are sometimes experienced within the same study in both cases and/or controls. Below we summarize results of studies focused exclusively on eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis relevant to endometrial function and dysfunction and biomarker discovery, followed by studies focused on ovarian endometriomas, superficial, and/or deep infiltrating disease, and eutopic endometrium, relevant to disease heterogeneity, pathophysiology, pathogenesis, and in the setting of progestins – commonly prescribed for symptom management of patients with endometriosis and dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain.\\nTable 1.

Adapted from Giudice et al 4 , with permission. Eutopic endometrium Window of implantation epithelial abnormalities in infertile endometriosis patients Endometrial biopsies of cases with stage I/II disease (revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) scoring system) 45 and infertility (n=3 WOI, n=3 early proliferative phase) versus n=7 fertile controls without disease (3 WOI, 3 proliferative, 1 late secretory phase) were studied by Huang et al 34 . A total of 128,243 cells were sequenced, and 30 type/cell type clusters were identified. Notably, a unique epithelial cell cluster in WOI endometrium of endometriosis patients was identified that lacked expression of two key genes associated with implantation: PAEP (progesterone-associated endometrial protein) and CXCL14 (chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 14) ( Figure 2 ). PAEP, also known as glycodelin A and placental protein 14, is involved in immune response regulation, promoting opening of the WOI by lowering maternal immune responses to an implanting embryo 46 . CXCL14 is involved in activating the innate immune response stimulating chemotaxis of uterine natural killer cells (uNK) and other monocytes to epithelial glands for implantation 46 . Other findings included absence of normal variation of endometrial uNK and T cell numbers across the cycle, and lower anti-inflammatory IL-10 and more pro-inflammatory cytokines expressed in endometrial immune cells in the WOI versus in the proliferative phase in cases and the opposite in controls. Notably, 11 ligand–receptor pairs were upregulated between endometrial immune and epithelial cells during the WOI of cases. Figure 2. Absence of key genes that open the window of implantation in eutopic endometrial epithelial cluster in infertile patients with Stage I/II endometriosis.

Expression patterns of PAEP and CXCL14 projected on t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) plot. From Huang et al, 2023 34 , with permission. Thus, lower epithelial receptivity markers, abnormal immune cell frequencies, a pro- inflammatory WOI, and new insights into cell-cell communications between epithelium and immune cells support an important role of the immune system and an adverse environment for embryo implantation for fertility and potentially for poor pregnancy outcomes in patients with stage I/II endometriosis who do achieve pregnancy versus fertile controls. Endometrial subcellular alterations across the cycle in endometriosis patients In a recent study, our group sequenced eutopic endometrium (237,620 cells) from 29 subjects with endometriosis (stages I/II and III/IV) and 15 controls without disease (7 healthy controls, 8 with symptomatic uterine fibroids), across the menstrual cycle 36 . We identified 5 main cell groups: stromal fibroblasts, smooth muscle, endothelial, epithelial, and immune. In the latter, further analysis revealed 18 sub-populations including uterine NK cells, T cell subsets, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Epithelial subpopulations comprised glandular, luminal and ciliated cells, with abnormal expression of CXCL14, PAEP, CCL20 , MMP7, and SFRP4 genes in cases, regardless of phase. Endometrium in controls with FIGO Type 2 uterine fibroids revealed overexpression of WFDC2 and DAXX genes in cases. In immune cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, cytokine production, stress signal and pro-inflammatory pathways in cases were noted, similar to Huang et al 34 findings, and enriched pathways in epithelial and ciliated cells related to migration and cell motility were higher in cases. Cell communication analysis revealed a complex network of inflammatory pathways, with significant involvement of classical monocytes and NK cells. Finally, genes implicated in ovarian cancer were upregulated in endometrium of cases compared to controls, confirming known association of endometriosis with specific subtypes of ovarian cancer 12 . Thus, in the eutopic endometrium in patients with endometriosis, there are numerous alterations in specific cell types across the cycle versus controls without disease and disease-free controls with uterine fibroids 36 . These can predispose to impaired fertility and tissue dyshomeostasis. Menstrual endometrium, disease pathophysiology, candidate biomarker discovery A recent scRNAseq study 32 of endometrial tissue in menstrual efflux (not biopsies) of n=11 cases with laparoscopic evidence of endometriosis (undefined stage) (11,924 cells) and n=9 healthy controls with no disease or symptoms (14,327 cells) revealed 18 cell clusters. These included abundant uNKs, stromal fibroblast, epithelial, B, T, and myeloid cell clusters, and a small plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) cluster. Further analysis separated data by cases vs controls and revealed a marked decrease in uNK1 and uNK2 cells and significantly enriched B cells in cases ( Figure 3A ). Log2 odds ratio (OR) analysis confirmed uNK1/2 significantly enriched in controls and B cells greatly enriched in cases ( Figure 3B ). Moreover, menstrual endometrium scRNA seq revealed decreased decidualization markers in stromal fibroblasts (reflecting P 4 -resistance) and pro-inflammatory stromal cells, as observed by others in FACS-sorted cell analyses and in vitro cell culture studies 6 , 47 . Figure 3. Distinct Cell Compositions and Cell Enrichment in Menstrual Endometrium from patients with Endometriosis versus Controls and Model of Disease. Open in a new tab Panels A and B show low abundance of uNK1 and uNK2 cells and high abundance of B cells in patients with endometriosis. Panel C shows proposed pathogenesis and pathophysiology implied by the data. From Shih et al, 2022 32 , with permission. Overall, this study demonstrates that menstrual endometrium (commonly referred to as a “liquid biopsy of the endometrium”) reflects secretory endometrium abnormalities as possible biomarkers of disease. The proposed disease model is shown in Figure 3C wherein defective endometrial stromal fibroblast decidualization is driven by multiple factors including inflammation, chronic endometritis, stress, and/or P 4 -resistance – which all have clinical relevance for pregnancy establishment and success, as well as tissue homeostasis. This, in turn, may direct fibroblast differentiation to a chronic inflammatory phenotype and senescence, which may also impair decidualization. Reduced decidualization may also compromise the infiltration and proliferation of uNK cells, likely to be important for senescent cell removal and important for an optimal setting for embryo nidation 32 . Ectopic endometrium Superficial peritoneal lesions display basalis epithelial stem cell markers In their landmark spatial-temporal single cell transcriptomic study 48 , García-Alonso et al 20 analyzed endometrium (3 functionalis and 6 full thickness (functionalis and basalis) tissues) across the cycle and identified 14 unique cell clusters that localized to corresponding endometrial compartments and niches. The proposed endometrial epithelial stem-cell niche resides within the basalis layer and contains SOX9+ cells and other “stem” markers (e.g., LGR5, SSEA1, β-catenin, N-cadherin) 49 , 50 , and Garcia-Alonso et al 20 found proliferative SOX9+LGR5+ cells mapped to the basalis stem cell niche. Epithelial stem cells are believed to play a role in endometriosis pathogenesis, and by leveraging bulk (microarray) transcriptomic data of superficial peritoneal lesions (9 red, 9 white, 11 black) ( GSE141549 ), this team identified enrichment of SOX9+LGR5+ markers in peritoneal lesions in the proliferative phase, compared to normal endometrium (n=42) and peritoneum (n=12) 20 . A proliferative phenotype of endometriosis lesion epithelial cells is consistent with P 4 -resistance noted in endometriosis 4 , 6 . Moreover, dysfunctional epithelium as a major driver of endometrial diseases, including endometriosis, and discovery of SOX9+LGR5+ stem-like populations dominant in endometriosis peritoneal lesions are foundational observations about pathogenesis and pathophysiology of superficial endometriosis disease lesions deriving from the basalis layer epithelium. Endometrioma, superficial and deep infiltrating endometriosis cell atlas A comprehensive scRNAseq analysis of >370,000 individual cells from 8 ovarian endometriomas, 28 superficial and deep disease lesions, 10 eutopic endometrium, 4 unaffected ovary, and 4 endometriosis-free peritoneum samples, has resulted in a cell atlas of endometrial-type epithelial cells, stromal cells, and microenvironment cell populations across tissue types 35 . Samples were derived from 17 cases (9 only endometriosis; 8 endometriosis and adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, and/or uterine polyps). 14 were cycling (7 proliferative and 7 secretory phases), and 3 were on contraceptive steroids ( Table 1 ). Controls (n=4) were postmenopausal (3) or perimenopausal (1), without endometriosis but with uterine fibroids +/− adenomyosis +/− uterine polyps, and all were on hormonal replacement regimens. Histologic and macroscopic features of specimens from one patient, shown in Figure 4A , underscore the heterogeneity of the lesions by cell abundance, cell types, and tissue architecture. Figure 4.

Correlations Based on Cluster Frequency Across All Specimens Profiled by scRNAseq. Panel C. Epithelial differential gene expression and signaling pathways in endometriomas and superficial and deep disease (P < 0.05 and log2 FC > 1). From Fonseca et al, 2023 35 , with permission. The major cell types identified from scRNAseq of all cells from n=49 samples comprising the 5 major tissue classes (endometrioma, peritoneal endometriosis (deep and superficial), unaffected peritoneum, eutopic endometrium, unaffected ovary) included epithelial, smooth muscle, mesenchymal, endothelial, mast, myeloid, B, and T/NKT cells, and erythrocytes. Correlations based on cluster frequency across all specimens profiled by scRNAseq are shown in Figure 4B and reveal 3 main clusters: 1) mainly endometriosis specimens; 2) mix of endometriomas (5 of the 8 endometrioma specimens) and eutopic endometrium (5 of the 10 eutopic samples; 3) only controls: unaffected ovary and 5 of the 10 eutopic endometrium samples 35 . Endometrioma, endometrium, superficial and deep endometriosis epithelia revealed distinct cell subtypes and signaling pathways, and endometriomas displayed markedly different epithelial differential gene expression and signaling pathways compared to deep and superficial peritoneal disease and eutopic endometrium ( Figure 4C ). Interestingly, endometriomas displayed immune cell and complement activation and were enriched in B cells and plasma cells, suggesting possible infection in endometriomas and a unique role for B cells which have received limited attention in endometriosis pathophysiology 51 – 53 . Peritoneal disease was enriched in mast cells and T/NK-T cells engaging novel immune targets, and some histologically negative mesothelium surprisingly had disease signatures, although depth of lesion evaluation for endometriosis tissue may vary among pathologists. Endometrial-type epithelial cells and fibroblasts exhibited differential gene expression associated with deep or superficial disease status ( Figure 5 ). Interestingly, deep infiltrating disease epithelium displayed upregulation of nerve growth factor, suggesting a role of the epithelium in promoting innervation of this disease type which is particularly painful 12 . Figure 5. Molecular signatures of epithelial and stromal cells in superficial peritoneal and deep endometriosis differ. Open in a new tab Endometrial-type epithelial cells ( Panel A ) and fibroblasts ( Panel B ) exhibit DGE associated with deep or superficial status. From Fonseca et al, 2023 35 , with permission. While somatic mutations have been reported in endometrium and endometriosis lesions, mainly involving KRAS activating mutations and ARID1A loss of function mutations 54 , 55 , Fonseca et al 35 confirmed these somatic mutations in various lesions ( Figure 6A ) and demonstrated in vivo transcriptional consequences of these mutations at the single cell level ( Figure 6B ). ARID1A mutation was associated with pro-lymphangiogenic stroma ( Figure 6C ) and adjacent mesothelium pro-inflammatory features and ciliated epithelial signatures - consistent with ovarian oncogenic potential. It is well-known that endometrioid ovarian cancer (EOC) and clear cell ovarian cancer (CCOC) arise in association with endometriosis, suggesting endometrial-type epithelial cells may be precursors for these tumors. A multi-subject single cell deconvolution analysis of the single cell data ( Figure 7 ) revealed strong enrichment of signatures for ciliated endometrial-type epithelial cells compared with the other keratin-positive clusters. In contrast, high grade serous ovarian cancer, an epithelial ovarian cancer type, not believed to originate from endometriosis epithelial cells, showed no pattern for preferential enrichment of any epithelial cluster.

From Fonseca et al, 2023 35 , with permission. Key takeaways: Endometrium and all three lesion types versus control endometrium displayed different cell/molecular signatures across tissues, consistent with restructuring/transcriptional reprogramming in lesions. Epithelial and stroma differed by site with striking differential gene expression in endometriomas and peritoneal lesions suggesting these are distinct disease entities. Superficial peritoneal and deep infiltrative endometriosis epithelium and fibroblasts had some differential gene expression and pathways, but similar structural genes to each other, suggesting they are part of the same continuum and distinct from endometrioma. While this study is a tour de force of endometriosis lesion and eutopic endometrium single cell transcriptomic analysis giving major insights into cell- and tissue-specific features and functions, including oncogenic potential of endometrioma epithelial cells, it underscores some of the challenges in conducting these types of studies. These include the presence of co-existing gynecologic disorders that can confound data interpretation; cells sequenced comprise a minor population in most samples (e.g., <1% of cells profiled), and controls and normal tissues are challenging to obtain e.g., controls were peri- or post-menopausal on hormone replacement therapies and had other uterine disorders. Nonetheless, these data are important and provide foundational information for comparison with other studies on eutopic and ectopic lesions in endometriosis patients and controls without disease. Fibroblasts and immune cells: key contributors to a pro-inflammatory, angiogenic environment in endometriomas. Sequencing 55,000 single cells from 3 endometriomas, 3 matched eutopic endometrium, and 3 endometrial samples from controls without disease in the proliferative phase, Ma et al 31 found 9 cell type clusters: fibroblasts, macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and T, NK, epithelial, endothelial, and mast cells, and unknown. Thirteen fibroblast subtype clusters were identified with significant differences in subtype composition among ectopic endometrium, eutopic endometrium, and normal endometrium. Fibroblast subtypes from normal proliferative phase endometrium displayed enriched functions of DNA replication, repair, growth regulation, and metabolic processes. However, endometrioma fibroblasts comprised 4 subtypes: 1) cytokine, inflammatory response; 2) FGF stimulation, immune response; 3) extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, cell adhesion; 4) angiogenesis, hypoxia response, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), all of which were enriched in MAPK, TNF, IL-17, TGF-β signaling pathways. Fibroblasts from eutopic endometrium of cases displayed many pathways similar to normal tissue, but some features suggested a “transition state” from normal endometrium to endometrioma, involving TGF-β, MAPK, Rho-Rack, NF-kB, JAK-STAT, and EMT. A developmental trajectory was postulated based on these fibroblast features, with endometrioma fibroblasts derived from endometrial fibroblasts 31 , much as the epithelial cell population has been proposed, based on shared epithelial somatic mutations in these two tissues 54 . Thus, endometrioma and paired eutopic endometrium fibroblasts differ, and the single cell data support their key roles in disease pathogenesis. Analysis of immune cells revealed they differed significantly in normal endometrium, endometrioma, and paired eutopic tissue ( Figure 8A ). Specifically, T cell and uNK cell frequencies were lower, uNK cells were more active, and macrophages (Mφ) were enriched and had features of tissue remodeling versus eutopic endometrium 31 , similar to data from Fonseca et al 35 . Thus, in the proliferative phase, fibroblasts and immune cell subpopulations contribute to a pro-inflammatory, angiogenic environment in endometriomas. Moreover cell-to-cell communication/interactome analysis revealed that immune cells stimulate fibroblast adhesion and growth in endometriomas ( Figure 8B ), underscoring the power of single cell analyses to inform the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of endometriomas and cell-cell communications. Furthermore, recent observations indicated that Fusobacterium 56 and dysbiosis of gut 57 , 58 altered systemic and potentially local immune functions, contributing to the development of endometriosis. Notably, while transcriptomic alterations of specific populations and sub- populations of the endometrium, lesions, and immune cells (local and peripheral) under these conditions awaits further study, antibiotic and nutritional therapies for dysbiosis is emerging as a new paradigm for treating endometriosis development and symptom management.

Endometriosis peritoneal and ovary lesions of patients on progestins As progestins are a mainstay of medical therapy for endometriosis-related pain 12 , analysis of lesions and endometrium of subjects taking progestins is highly valuable in understanding their effects on cell types and tissue features. Tan et al 33 performed scRNAseq on 122,000 cells from 14 individuals, selective cell localization by imaging mass cytometry, and validations in endometrial epithelial organoid cultures. Peritoneal and/or ovarian disease and endometrium from 19 cases (rASRM stage II-IV) included 14 on norethindrone (NETA) + ethinyl estradiol (EthE 2 ), 2 on drosperinone + EthE 2 , 1 on levonorgestrel + EthE 2 , 1 on only NETA, 1 menstrual phase, and 8 controls with no endometriosis or inflammatory conditions: 4 on NETA + EthE 2 , 2 in proliferative phase, 1 on medroxyprogesterone acetate, 1 on norgestromin + EthE 2 . The peritoneal lesions had similar cell compositions as eutopic endometrium but dysregulated innate immune and vascular components - vastly different from ovarian endometriosis lesions. The authors identified a unique perivascular mural cell specific to the peritoneal lesions with features promoting neo- angiogenesis and immune cell trafficking. They also identified a progenitor-like epithelial subpopulation, different from the SOX9+LGR5+ epithelial subpopulation found by Garcia-Alfonso et al 20 . Analysis of peritoneal lesion myeloid populations of immunomodulatory Mφ and DCs revealed a coordinated immunotolerant phenotype in the disease microenvironment, promoting immunosurveillance escape and thus conducive to lesion establishment. Overall, the data demonstrate that immune and vascular components of peritoneal endometriosis favor neo-angiogenesis and an immune tolerant niche in the peritoneal cavity, beneficial for lesion establishment and growth. These are remarkable findings given that most subjects were on hormone suppressive therapies for pain [progestin (+ estrogen)] and raises the issue of how efficacious these therapies are on specific cells and the role of estrogenic components in disease management. This valuable single cell atlas of disease from patients largely on hormonal treatments offers the opportunity for comparisons of cell types and features in peritoneal lesions and endometriomas in the setting of other hormonal treatments and/or in various phases of the cycle to interpret efficacies of selective therapies on cell-specific pathways and cell-cell communications. Adenomyosis through single cell glasses Uterine compartments relevant to adenomyosis pathogenesis include the endometrial-myometrial junction (EMJ) [basalis and lower functionalis endometrium + sub-endometrial inner myometrium], all of Mullerian origin and displaying cycling estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) 59 – 61 ( Figure 9 ). Few molecular and genomic studies of the EMJ in adenomyosis uteri have been conducted, likely as access to basalis and inner myometrium requires hysterectomy versus the functionalis, which can be readily obtained by office biopsy. Figure 9. The endometrial-myometrial junction (EMJ). Open in a new tab Panel A. Histology of human uterine endometrium and myometrium compartments (H&E staining). Panel B : Transvaginal ultrasound midsagittal image of uterine compartments. Panel C. Schematic of uterine compartments. Adapted from Naftlin and Jurkovic, 2009 61 , with permission. Bulk analyses: Studies to date in adenomyosis patients using immunohistochemistry and qPCR reveal abnormal endometrial functionalis epithelial aromatase expression (thus high E 2 milieu), elevated stromal fibroblast IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 secretion, TH17-Treg imbalance, altered uNK receptors, and aberrant P 4 -signaling 5 , 26 , 62 – 64 – very similar to endometrium of patients with endometriosis except for IL-17 and TH17-Tregulatory cell imbalance. We conducted bulk RNA seq of endometrial functionalis 65 and a study on separate compartments of EMJ inner myometrium and endometrium from patients with diffuse adenomyosis versus controls in the proliferative phase 66 . ECM remodeling, inflammation, IL-17 signaling, and mTOR signaling were enriched in endometrium, and inflammation, pain, and neuronal signaling pathways in myometrium, consistent with clinical symptoms of this disorder. Single cell analyses: Two recent publications have analyzed adenomyosis lesions 67 , 68 . They are important beginnings to understanding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of adenomyosis, building upon bulk transcriptomic data, which could be further mined in deconvolution studies to validate new and likely forthcoming additional single cell data. Liu et al 67 sequenced 42,292 cells derived from a control endometrium of a patient with uterine fibroids and eutopic (functionalis) endometrium and matched ectopic lesion from a patient with adenomyosis (type and menstrual cycle phase undefined). The data revealed seven distinct cell types. Comparison of the data from the lesion with those from eutopic matched endometrium and control endometrium revealed processes involved in progression of normal→endometrial→adenomyosis epithelial phenotypes. These included motility, proliferation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and cancer, consistent with the theory of collective cell migration and invasion into the myometrium of endometrial-derived cells. The novel data set revealed vascular mimicry (important in tumor formation) and epithelial transformation to endothelial cells. It is anticipated that the novel epithelial→endothelial transition phenotype will likely be mined in the future and expanded studies of adenomyosis and perhaps other gynecologic disorders and may serve as a unique cell type for drug targeting. Bulun and colleagues 68 reported results of single cell analyses of adenomyosis lesions and matched eutopic endometrium and myometrium from 3 subjects, all with diffuse adenomyosis and in the proliferative phase (total of 9 samples and 66,000 cells sequenced). They identified 11 cell types in eutopic endometrium of patients with adenomyosis ( Figure 10 A ). Fibroblast-like cells comprised a large fraction (36%), and pseudotime analysis revealed they originate from pericyte progenitors that differentiate to ER+ and PR+ endometrial stromal fibroblasts. Notably, the pseudotime trajectory was found to end with ciliated epithelial cells, suggesting mesenchymal- epithelial transition at play in this tissue. In adenomyosis lesions, they identified 13 cell types including 2 (smooth muscle cells and neurons) not found in the endometrium of the same patients ( Figure 10 B ). The adenomyosis lesions contained even more fibroblast-like cells compared to endometrium (50% versus 36%, respectively). In contrast to matched endometrium, the fibroblast-like cells did not originate from pericyte progenitors and differentiated to ECM-expressing fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMC). Also, myometrial SMC were found to derive from fibroblast-like clusters. Moreover, the WNT inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein (SFRP) family expressed in fibroblast-like clusters were similar across tissues - endometrium, adenomyosis and myometrium 68 . Figure 10. Fibroblasts and epithelial cell subtypes differ in endometrium and adenomyosis. Open in a new tab Panel A. UMAP of cell types and fibroblast trajectories in endometrium. B. UMAP of cell types and fibroblast trajectories in adenomyosis. Panel C. Progesterone resistance of epithelial subtypes in adenomyosis. Panel D. WNT signaling pathway network. From Yildiz et al, 2023 68 , with permission. Regarding the epithelial cells, P 4 -resistance was found in ciliated and unciliated cells in adenomyosis tissue versus matched eutopic endometrium ( Figure 10 C ) – this is a key finding regarding treatment efficiencies. Further data analysis revealed that the canonical WNT/SFRP pathway signaling was uniquely activated in adenomyosis unciliated and ciliated epithelium and paracrine signaling fibroblast-like mesenchymal: epithelial interaction networks ( Figure 10D ), opening new avenues for drug discovery for this disorder. The epithelial→endothelial transition reported by Liu et al 67 was not detected in this study and may be due to different adenomyosis lesion types, cycle phase, patient age, and other variables. Whether the findings of these two studies involving patients with diffuse adenomyosis also apply to other forms of adenomyosis ( Figure 1 ) is unknown and is an opportunity to investigate cell features wherein novel therapeutics could be derived. Moreover, recent data suggest that the endometrial and vaginal microbiomes differ in patients with versus without adenomyosis 69 , 70 , raising the possibility of adjunctive antibiotic therapies for symptomatic patients with disease. Additionally, further study of the local and systemic immune system cells and their subtypes as well as in affected uterine tissues at single cell resolution are warranted.',\n",
